# OfflineGPT desktop releases

The `Desktop Release` workflow builds download-ready macOS, Windows, and Linux
applications from a semantic-version tag. Versions live in tags; package files
keep their development placeholders.

## Cut a release

```bash
pnpm release:cut
pnpm release:cut minor
pnpm release:cut --version 1.0.0
pnpm release:cut:watch
```

The command requires a clean, fully pushed `main` branch. It creates an
annotated tag and pushes only that tag. The workflow creates a draft GitHub
release, uploads every installer, generates checksums, and publishes only when
all platform builds pass.

## Rebuild an existing release

```bash
gh workflow run "Desktop Release" \
  --repo soumyacodes007/offline-gpt \
  -f tag=vX.Y.Z
```

## Verify

```bash
gh run list --repo soumyacodes007/offline-gpt --workflow "Desktop Release" --limit 3
gh release view vX.Y.Z --repo soumyacodes007/offline-gpt --json isDraft,isLatest,assets
```

Expected downloads include macOS ARM64 and x64 DMGs, a Windows x64 installer,
Linux x64 AppImage and tarball builds, plus `SHA256SUMS.txt`.

See `docs/RELEASING.md` for the complete maintainer flow.
