# Releasing OfflineGPT

Desktop releases are built by GitHub Actions for macOS, Windows, and Linux. A
semantic-version tag is the release source of truth; committed package versions
remain `0.0.0-dev` and are stamped only inside the build jobs.

## Publish a release

1. Make sure `main` is clean, pushed, and passing its required checks.
2. Create and push a semantic-version tag:

   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "OfflineGPT v1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

3. Watch the **Desktop Release** workflow. It creates a draft release, builds
   each platform independently, uploads the installers, generates
   `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and publishes the release only after every build succeeds.

The workflow publishes:

- macOS Apple Silicon: DMG and ZIP
- macOS Intel: DMG and ZIP
- Windows x64: NSIS EXE installer
- Linux x64: AppImage and compressed tarball

## Rebuild an existing tag

Use the Actions page to run **Desktop Release** manually and provide the
existing tag. Assets are replaced atomically by filename, so a failed build can
be repaired without creating a second release.

## Local packaging

Build only on the target operating system when possible:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
node scripts/release/stamp-version.mjs --version 1.0.0
pnpm --filter @offlinegpt/desktop build:electron
pnpm --dir apps/desktop exec electron-builder --config electron-builder.yml --publish never
```

Local version stamping changes package manifests temporarily. Restore those
files before committing; release versions belong to tags, not source files.

## Signing

The public workflow produces usable community builds without requiring private
signing credentials. Configure Apple notarization and Windows code signing
before presenting installers as verified publisher builds.
